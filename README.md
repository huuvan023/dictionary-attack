# Dictionary Attack
### A nodejs script to guess cyberoam password for any given username

##### Disclaimer:
I wrote this script just to demonstrate that how some one with a fair knowledge of web-development can exploits
weak passwords. I chose our college captive portal for experiment but same principle can be applied to any website
which are vulnerable to attack. This is just for education purpose and I do not intend to steal any information.

###### Dictionary Attacks:
A dictionary attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing, typically derived from a list of
words such as in a dictionary. In this demo, I am going to use a text file injectFinal2.txt (see the file above)
containing about 1M venerable password
Dictionary attacks often succeed because many people have a tendency to choose short passwords that are ordinary 
words or common passwords, or simple variants obtained, for example, by appending a digit or punctuation character.
